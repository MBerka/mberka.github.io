The Controlled Random Search (see PDF) is a basic heuristic used in optimization (minimization of multivariable systems). I have implemented graphical interfaces based on it in both Matlab and LabVIEW, each able to identify the input variables in the expression and return the input values at which it finds the minimum output. The LabVIEW VIs, a standalone standalone application based on them, and Matlab source files are attached.
