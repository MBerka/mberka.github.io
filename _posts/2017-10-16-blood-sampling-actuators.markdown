My MSc research involved developing new techniques for collecting blood for wearable glucose monitoring applications. The [thesis text](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/11023/4199/ucalgary_2017_berka_martin.pdf) and [summary](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/handle/11023/4199) are publicly available from the University of Calgary.

Core concept of the main area of investigation: Shape memory alloy wires contract to pull a slider, which drives an L-shaped needle against one wall of a custom opening, causing the needle to rotate downwards.</div>

The most sophisticated version of the slider-needle assembly: the L-shaped needle was embedded in a disposable plastic part, free to rotate between 15 and 90Â° relative to the main plane. The plastic part was fitted onto a metal slider, providing isolation and a reliable interface between single- and multi-use parts of the mechanism.</div>
