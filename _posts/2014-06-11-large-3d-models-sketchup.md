The [SketchUp 3D modeling tool][sketch] lends itself to laying out spaces, both real and imagined. While lacking the simulation, analysis and documentation capabilities of a full CAD program, a number of fun files have been gathering dust offline for too long, and are now [up in the 3D Warehouse][gallery], rough edges and all. In many cases, it's hard to explain the goal or logic, but not the fun involved in creating them!
