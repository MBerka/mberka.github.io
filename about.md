Cloud. Home automation. IoT. Quantified self. Rapid prototyping. Wearables.

New ideas are sparked by collisions - between technologies, disciplines and applications. Modern product development requires the ability to interface, integrate, and iterate, growing the embers of an idea into a roaring flame.

Whether a system involves circuit boards, small moving parts, software, or integration - I love bringing it to life.

- A handful of [medical device publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=7DeEmJ8AAAAJ) are available from their publishers.
- I have worked on a variety of other hardware and software systems for startups and small businesses, not discussed here due to non-disclosure requirements. Interested in developing your own? [Contact me](http://www.mberka.com/contact-me) - I do not always have time for new projects, but can usually find a free hour of advice.
