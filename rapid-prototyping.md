Specifically, physical prototyping: I have designed for and overseen 3D printing and CNC machining. The relevant subsections provide a few basic resources for each subject.

Of course, I can produce digital models as well - this Fusion 360 model of an exercise armchair was conceptualized and crudely assembled over 24 hours, in cooperation with [Shelly-Ginelle Sicat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shelly-ginelle-sicat-091185b9/).

Here is a later [video demonstrating its motion](/assets/ExerciseChair.mp4).
